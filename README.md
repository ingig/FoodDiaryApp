# Food Diary App

## Overview
The Food Diary App allows users to log their meals using natural language input and automatically estimates nutritional values like calories, fats, carbs, and proteins. The app supports queries about past meals and modifications to the diary entries.

### Features
- Log meals in natural language, e.g., "ate chicken 100g, with broccoli and cauliflower."
- Analyze nutritional content automatically.
- Query historical data, e.g., "What did I eat yesterday?" or "What is my carb intake today?"
- Update entries, e.g., "I had 2 sandwiches, not one."
- Remove the latest entry with a simple command.

## Installation

1. Download `FoodDiaryApp.zip` from this repository or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Plang installed on your system. If not, install it from [PLangHQ releases](https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/releases).
3. Extract the downloaded zip file and navigate to the extracted directory.

## Usage
To run the app, open up your terminal/command in the directory FoodDiaryApp folder, and type in `plang` and press enter

```bash
plang
```

_If you have OpenAI API key, you can start with the command `plang --llmservice=openai`_


Once started, you can interact with the Food Diary App using a Nostr client like [Amethyst (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitorpamplona.amethyst&hl=en&gl=US) or [Damus (iPhone)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/damus/id1628663131). Hereâ€™s how to get started:

- **Log an Entry:** Send a message detailing what you ate, e.g., "ate chicken 100g, with broccoli and cauliflower."
- **Query Entries:** Ask questions like, "What did I eat yesterday?" or "How many carbs did I consume today?"
- **Correct Entries:** Send corrections as needed, e.g., "I had 2 sandwiches, not one."
- **Delete Entries:** To remove entries, send a command like "remove my last entry."

## Customization

### Modifying System Setup
You can alter the app's behavior by modifying the `.txt` files located in the `llm` folders. Files that are named '*System' are the system definition for the AI. You can add things like 'User is woman aged 45', or 'Reply as sarcastic british comedian'. 

### Change the app code
Plang is a natural language programming language, this makes it easy to modify.

**Example**

To change the information sent by the messaging app, you might adjust the `Insert.goal` file. For instance, to switch from displaying calories to carbs in the app's messages:

Before:
```plang
- call goal SendMessage content=%foodEntry.emojis% - Calories: %foodEntry.dish.totalCalories%
```

After:
```plang
- call goal SendMessage content=%foodEntry.emojis% - Carbs: %foodEntry.dish.totalCarbs%
```

#### Rebuild the App
After making any changes to the `.goal` files, rebuild the application to apply the changes:
```bash
plang build
```
And restart your app.
